                <h3 class="heading_style">Themes & Symbolism</h3>
               <p>Season 1 of Yellowjackets explores themes of survival, trauma, and the descent into savagery, setting the foundation for the show’s psychological and supernatural elements. As the survivors struggle to stay alive in the wilderness, their moral boundaries begin to erode, hinting at the ritualistic cannibalism foreshadowed in the opening scene. Power struggles emerge, particularly between Jackie, Shauna, and Lottie, reflecting the shift from logic and reason to a more primal, instinct-driven existence. Meanwhile, in the present-day timeline, the adult characters grapple with PTSD, guilt, and buried secrets, proving that the past still has a hold on them. The show also plays with the idea of supernatural vs. psychological horror, leaving audiences questioning whether the eerie events in the wilderness are real or simply the result of stress, fear, and starvation-induced hallucinations. Lottie’s visions and growing influence suggest a higher power or force at play, but it remains unclear whether it is truly supernatural or just a manifestation of belief and desperation. Ultimately, Season 1 establishes a world where reality and illusion blur, forcing both the characters and the audience to question what is truly happening.</p>
