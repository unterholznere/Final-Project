                        <p>In the 1996 timeline of Yellowjackets, the New Jersey state champion girls' soccer team boards a flight to Seattle for a tournament, but their plane crashes in the remote Canadian wilderness. Stranded with limited supplies and no immediate hope of rescue, the survivors must learn to fend for themselves, forming alliances and power struggles that grow more intense over time. As the months pass, starvation, harsh weather, and fear push them to their limits, leading to eerie rituals, violence, and even cannibalism. Some, like Misty, embrace the chaos, while others, like Shauna and Nat, struggle to hold onto their morality. Meanwhile, Lottie begins to exhibit strange, almost prophetic visions, sparking belief in supernatural forces controlling their fate. As desperation sets in, friendships are tested, leaders emerge, and the group slowly descends into something darker and more primal. The mystery of what truly happened in the wilderness lingers, with only fragments revealed as the series progresses.</p>

                        <p>In the 2021 timeline of Yellowjackets, the known surviving women—Shauna, Nat, Misty, and Taissa—struggle to maintain normal lives while hiding the dark secrets of their past. Shauna appears to be a suburban mom, but beneath the surface, she harbors deep resentment and a dangerous side. Nat battles addiction and obsession with uncovering the truth about their past, while Misty, now a manipulative caregiver, uses her cunning nature to keep control over those around her. Taissa, a rising political figure, is haunted by sleepwalking episodes and disturbing visions, threatening both her career and family life. When an anonymous blackmailer threatens to expose what really happened in the wilderness, the women are forced back together, unraveling old wounds and reigniting their paranoia. As their trauma resurfaces, they must face the question: did they ever truly escape the wilderness, or did it follow them back?</p>
